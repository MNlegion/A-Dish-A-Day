    "ingredients": ["3 lbs chicken bone-in thighs and drumsticks, skin removed, chopped crosswise against the bone",
    "1 tsp kosher salt, more to taste",
    "1/2 tsp black pepper, more to taste",
    "1/4 cup ghee",
    "1″ ginger, grated",
    "4 cloves garlic, minced",
    "2 green chile peppers (jalapeno, serrano, or similar), thinly sliced",
    "1 cinnamon stick",
    "6 whole cloves",
    "2 black cardamom pods, lightly smashed",
    "2 green cardamom pods, lightly smashed",
    "1 bay leaf",
    "1 tsp cumin seeds",
    "2 onions, sliced",
    "2 tomatoes, chopped",
    "2 tsp ground turmeric",
    "2 tsp kashmiri red chili powder (or 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper)",
    "1 cup chicken stock, more as needed",
    "1 cup full fat plain yogurt",
    "1/2 lb lotus root, peeled and sliced into ¼” slices",
    "2 drops kewra water (optional)",
    "1/2 bunch cilantro, divided, to garnish"],
    "preperationStep": ["1. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper. Warm the ghee in a dutch oven or deep skillet over medium heat; working in batches, brown the chicken until golden on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and set aside the chicken as it browns.",

    "2. Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the ginger, garlic, chile peppers, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, bay leaf, and cumin seeds; saute until aromatic, but not burnt, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium, then stir in the onions and tomatoes; saute until softened, about 6 minutes, then stir in the turmeric, chili powder, and chicken stock. If youd like, you can blend this sauce in a high-speed blender until smooth, then pour it through a sieve for a velvety-smooth sauce; otherwise, proceed directly to the next step.",
    
    "3. Before the sauce returns to a simmer, ladle some of the sauce into the yogurt to temper, then stir the yogurt into the main sauce. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly to prevent the yogurt from curdling; simmer until the sauce has darkened and oil starts to form at the surface, about 15 minutes, stirring often to prevent scorching. Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the pot. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and gently simmer until the chicken is just cooked through but still firm, about 15 mins; add more stock only if the sauce gets too thick as it simmers.",
    
    "4. Stir in the lotus root and simmer until the chicken and lotus root are tender, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure each piece of chicken and lotus root spend time smothered in the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, stir in the kewra water, then serve garnished with cilantro."],

    "2a. Traeger grilling instructions: With the lid open, turn the switch on and set the temperature dial to “smoke”. Once the grill starts to emit smoke, close the lid and set the dial to 350F. Wait for it to reach temperature, then distribute the wings evenly over the grill grates. Grill until the wings are golden and its skin appears crispy at the edges, about 45 minutes. About halfway through cooking, rearrange the chicken so that the pieces that look more done than others are swapped with the less-cooked pieces.",
    
    "2b. Conventional grill instructions: Warm up the grill for indirect moderate heat: if using a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side; if using a gas grill, ignite the burners on one side. Place the chicken on the cool side of the grill and cook until the wings are golden and its skin appears crispy at the edges, about 45 minutes. About halfway through cooking, rearrange the chicken so that the pieces that look more done than others are swapped with the less-cooked pieces.",
    
    "3. As the chicken cooks, combine the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer until the sauce appears glossy, about 8 minutes, stirring often; remove from heat and set aside.",
    
    "4. Place the wings in a large mixing bowl, the pour in half of the sauce and toss to coat. Depending on how sticky you like your wings, add the remaining half of the wings and repeat the process, or serve on the side as a dip."],

Fry the chicken in batches until the internal temperature reaches 165F, about 10 minutes per side. As you finish each batch, place the cooked chicken pieces on a wire rack set over a baking sheet; put them in the oven to keep warm as you fry the remaining pieces."

    "preperationStep": [
      "1. Empty the pasta sauce into a saucepan and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low to keep warm while you prepare the chicken.",

      "2. Place the chicken flat on a cutting board, then slice the chicken lengthwise to make two thin butterflied cutlets. Gently pound with a meat tenderizer to an even thickness, about 1/2″, then set aside. Prepare three wide, shallow bowls to bread the cutlets. In the first bowl, combine the dusting ingredients. In the second bowl, add the beaten eggs. In the third bowl, add the breading ingredients.",

      "3. Now youre ready to start cooking. Preheat your oven to 350F. In a large skillet, warm the lard, ghee, or oil over medium/high heat (youre looking for an oil temp of 325F). Once the oil is warm, dust a chicken breast in the first bowl, then transfer to the second bowl and cover in egg, shake off any excess egg, then cover with the starch in the third bowl. Add to the skillet and repeat for however many breasts you can fit in the skillet at one time (dont bread the chicken until right before youre going to add it to the oil).",

      "4. Pan-fry the chicken until golden brown, about three minutes per side, then transfer to a baking sheet. Dont worry about whether the chicken it cooked through; the oven will finish it off. Add more oil if needed and repeat step #3 until all of the chicken has been pan-fried.",

      "5. Spoon the pasta sauce over the cutlets, then sprinkle on the cheese. Place in the oven to bake until the cheese has melted, about 8 minutes, then broil for 2 minutes or until the cheese is spotty and golden (watch it like a hawk at this point). Remove from the oven and serve."

    "description": "3-2-1 Smoked Ribs",
    "author": "Shazeen",
    "img": "/client/src/assets/images/beef-Smoked-Ribs.png",
    "ingredients": ["2 to 4 racks baby back or spare ribs",
    "1/2 cup barbecue rub (or your favorite BBQ rub)",
    "1/4 cup apple juice (or 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar + 3 tbsp water + 1 tsp honey)",
    "1/2 cup barbecue sauce (or your favorite BBQ sauce)"],
    "preperationStep": ["1. Remove the membrane from the bottom of the ribs, if they have it. It can be tricky, but try and peel off a corner piece, grab it firmly, and rip it all the way down. It takes some work, but this will expose the meat a bit better and make for a more flavorful and tender eating experience. Having a hard time? No worries, skip this step and move on (there's a lot of wiggle room in this recipe!).",

    "2. Rub the ribs all over with the barbecue rub. You don't need to coat it with rub, just enough so that you impart some flavor. If you have the time, you can leave the rub on for an hour or two (I wouldn't go much longer than that).",
    
    "3. Prepare your grill for indirect smoking (see the illustrated setup below), and shoot for a smoker temperature of about 225F (+/- 25F is fine!). Let some of that initial smoke burn off, about the first 5-10 minutes, which can impart an acrid flavor to your meat. Use hickory, apple, cherry, or another mild wood for the flavor.",
    
    "4. Place the ribs in the smoker and smoke for 3 hours. Be sure to monitor your wood and replenish as needed. This is the most important time to add smoke to the ribs!",
    
    "5. Next, wrap your ribs with two layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Right before sealing them up, pour in a bit of the apple juice; you don't need much. At this point you can either continue to cook them in your smoker (still at 225F), or transfer them to the oven to bake at 225F. The smoke won't really penetrate the foil at this point, so the oven should be fine. Smoke for 2 hours.",
    
    "6. Unwrap the ribs, and check them for doneness. You'll want to hold them with tongs and make sure they bend considerably - like they're close to tearing apart from gravity alone. Baby back ribs sometimes take longer than spare ribs. Once they're nice and bendy, brush with the barbecue sauce, then smoke (or bake) for another 1 hour, or until the sauce has caramelized. If you baked them in Step #5 but have the ability to put them back on the grill/smoker, definitely do that - finishing them in the oven should be used as a last resort (or if you're trying to save fuel).",
    
    "7. Rest the ribs for 5 minutes, then serve. Personally, I like to cut each rib individually with a pair of kitchen shears, to make it easier for the kids to eat. You do you."],
