    "recipeTitle": "Poronkäristys (Sautéed Reindeer)",
    "description": "This dish hails from Finland, but is enjoyed in Sweden, Norway and Russia as well. What I like about this recipe is that it makes no assumptions the key to this delicious meal is slicing it thinly, seasoning it sparingly, and nudging it gently towards tenderness with a combination of light braising and some crisping at the end. The whole process takes about two hours from start to finish, but it is totally worth it.",

    "recipeTitle": "Hearty Bison Stew",
    "description": "Although the American bison is often referred to as a buffalo, it is only a distant relative of the true buffalo (like the Asian water buffalo). Its closest relative is the European bison, also known as a wisent. Its meat is usually leaner than beef, high in iron, and sweeter-tasting. Because of its leanness, I find that it is best served in slow-cooked meals like this stew, as hamburgers, or as a grilled meat (like shish-kabobs) served medium-rare.",
    "author": "Wild Bill",

    "img": "./images/Bison-Stew.webp",

    "ingredient": [
      "1lb US Wellness Meats bison stew meat",
      "2 tbsp coconut oil or ghee",
      "1/2 tsp each salt and pepper",
      "1 medium onion, chopped finely",
      "2 cloves garlic, minced",
      "1/4 cup red wine",
      "1 cup each beef and chicken stock/broth",
      "1/2 tsp dried thyme",

      "1/2 cup frozen peas",
      "1 tsp chopped fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "preparationStep": [
      "1. As with most of my red meat-based roasts/stews, I prefer a combination of chicken and beef stock as the braising liquid; it gives the dish its tastiness without an overbearing “beefiness”.",
      "2. Remove the bison meat from its packaging, and gently rinse with cold water and allow to drain dry. I was amazed at how well the stew meat was cut, and how lean and colorful it was!",
      "3. In a french/dutch oven, heat up the oil/ghee on medium/high heat for about five minutes. Season the meat with 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper, and brown the meat for a few minutes per side, in batches if needed. Altogether it took me eight minutes to brown the meat. Remove the browned meat and set it aside, leaving the oil inside the french/dutch oven.",
      "4. Preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Reduce the dutch oven heat to medium, and add the chopped onions and a dash of salt. Saute for about five minutes, until the onions are softened. Add the minced garlic and continue to saute for another 30 seconds. Add the red wine, beef and chicken broths, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring everything to a simmer.",
      "6. Once the broth is simmering, add the browned bison meat, and place in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.",
      "7. While it is cooking, prepare your potatoes, carrots, and parsnip.",
      "8. After an hour and 15 minutes, add the potatoes, carrots, and parsnip and return it to the oven. Bake for another 40 minutes, until the vegetables and meat are tender. Remove the bay leaves.",
      "9. Rather than deal with making a flour roux or working with potato/arrowroot starch to thicken the stew, we are going to use the ingredients that are already in the stew. Pretty resourceful, huh?",
      "10. With a ladle, remove about 1 cup of the cooked potatoes, carrots, and parsnip (be sure to pick out the bison meat), and about 1/2 cup of the remaining broth. Blend your cup of veggies and 1/2 cup of broth together, making a sort of “potato/veggie” paste. Pour this paste back into the dutch oven, and stir everything together, while also stirring in the frozen peas.",
      "11. Cover and simmer on the stovetop on med/low heat for five minutes. Check for taste, adding salt and pepper as needed."

    "recipeTitle": "Pichelsteiner",
    "description": "Pichelsteiner is a very typical stew, found in similar shapes and sizes all over the world. There are several stories to explain its invention, a common trait among stews. One folk tale details how a farmer wife fed the stew to a group of marauding soldiers, saving the day (and her family) with this new culinary invention. Another tale explains how a Bavarian chef prepared Pichelsteiner for party atop Büchelstein mountain (allegedly, the name of this dish morphed from there). Finally, the small Bavarian village of Regen, along the Czech border, claims ownership of this dish as well, which they have communally served at the anniversary of their church dedication in 1874.",

            "1. Empty the pasta sauce into a saucepan and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low to keep warm while you prepare the chicken.",
      
            "2. Place the chicken flat on a cutting board, then slice the chicken lengthwise to make two thin butterflied cutlets. Gently pound with a meat tenderizer to an even thickness, about 1/2″, then set aside. Prepare three wide, shallow bowls to bread the cutlets. In the first bowl, combine the dusting ingredients. In the second bowl, add the beaten eggs. In the third bowl, add the breading ingredients.",
      
            "3. Now youre ready to start cooking. Preheat your oven to 350F. In a large skillet, warm the lard, ghee, or oil over medium/high heat (youre looking for an oil temp of 325F). Once the oil is warm, dust a chicken breast in the first bowl, then transfer to the second bowl and cover in egg, shake off any excess egg, then cover with the starch in the third bowl. Add to the skillet and repeat for however many breasts you can fit in the skillet at one time (dont bread the chicken until right before youre going to add it to the oil).",
      
            "4. Pan-fry the chicken until golden brown, about three minutes per side, then transfer to a baking sheet. Dont worry about whether the chicken it cooked through; the oven will finish it off. Add more oil if needed and repeat step #3 until all of the chicken has been pan-fried.",
      
            "5. Spoon the pasta sauce over the cutlets, then sprinkle on the cheese. Place in the oven to bake until the cheese has melted, about 8 minutes, then broil for 2 minutes or until the cheese is spotty and golden (watch it like a hawk at this point). Remove from the oven and serve."

          "ingredient": ["2 to 4 racks baby back or spare ribs",
          "1/2 cup barbecue rub (or your favorite BBQ rub)",
          "1/4 cup apple juice (or 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar + 3 tbsp water + 1 tsp honey)",
          "1/2 cup barbecue sauce (or your favorite BBQ sauce)"],
          "preparationStep": ["1. Remove the membrane from the bottom of the ribs, if they have it. It can be tricky, but try and peel off a corner piece, grab it firmly, and rip it all the way down. It takes some work, but this will expose the meat a bit better and make for a more flavorful and tender eating experience. Having a hard time? No worries, skip this step and move on (there's a lot of wiggle room in this recipe!).",
      
          "2. Rub the ribs all over with the barbecue rub. You don't need to coat it with rub, just enough so that you impart some flavor. If you have the time, you can leave the rub on for an hour or two (I wouldn't go much longer than that).",
          
          "3. Prepare your grill for indirect smoking (see the illustrated setup below), and shoot for a smoker temperature of about 225F (+/- 25F is fine!). Let some of that initial smoke burn off, about the first 5-10 minutes, which can impart an acrid flavor to your meat. Use hickory, apple, cherry, or another mild wood for the flavor.",
          
          "4. Place the ribs in the smoker and smoke for 3 hours. Be sure to monitor your wood and replenish as needed. This is the most important time to add smoke to the ribs!",
          
          "5. Next, wrap your ribs with two layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Right before sealing them up, pour in a bit of the apple juice; you don't need much. At this point you can either continue to cook them in your smoker (still at 225F), or transfer them to the oven to bake at 225F. The smoke won't really penetrate the foil at this point, so the oven should be fine. Smoke for 2 hours.",
          
          "6. Unwrap the ribs, and check them for doneness. You'll want to hold them with tongs and make sure they bend considerably - like they're close to tearing apart from gravity alone. Baby back ribs sometimes take longer than spare ribs. Once they're nice and bendy, brush with the barbecue sauce, then smoke (or bake) for another 1 hour, or until the sauce has caramelized. If you baked them in Step #5 but have the ability to put them back on the grill/smoker, definitely do that - finishing them in the oven should be used as a last resort (or if you're trying to save fuel).",
          
          "7. Rest the ribs for 5 minutes, then serve. Personally, I like to cut each rib individually with a pair of kitchen shears, to make it easier for the kids to eat. You do you."],
